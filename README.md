# Datasets
The [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/) dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). Big thanks to Fabio for his research and time put in to creating the dataset and documentation, it is one of his personal projects. You will need to follow the steps outlined [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) to gain access to the dataset.
